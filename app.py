        **Common Solutions:**
        
        1. **Check Internet Connection**
           - Ensure you have a stable internet connection
           - Try opening other websites to verify connectivity
        
        2. **Firewall/Network Issues**
           - Check if your firewall is blocking Python/Streamlit
           - Try disabling VPN if you're using one
           - Ensure port 443 (HTTPS) is not blocked
        
        3. **Try Again**
           - Refresh the page and try again
           - Sometimes the download servers are temporarily busy
           - Wait 1-2 minutes and refresh
        
        4. **Alternative Solutions**
           - Try running from a different network
           - Check if your organization blocks model downloads
           - Try using a mobile hotspot temporarily
        
        **Technical Details:**
        - Models are downloaded from GitHub/Ultralytics servers
        - First run requires ~6-50MB download depending on model
        - Models are cached locally after first successful download

        **Choose one of these methods to use your phone camera:**
        
        ### Method 1: Direct Phone Camera (Easiest) üåü
        1. **Open this app on your phone's browser**:
           - Get your computer's IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
           - On phone: go to `http://192.168.1.100:8501`
        
        2. **Select "üì± Direct Phone Camera"** on your phone
        
        3. **Allow camera access** when prompted
        
        4. **Use your phone's camera directly** - no apps needed!
        
        ### Method 2: DroidCam (Best for Real-Time Video)
        1. **Download DroidCam**:
           - **Phone**: "DroidCam" app from Play Store/App Store
           - **Computer**: DroidCam Client from droidcam.com
        
        2. **Connect**: Open both apps and connect via WiFi or USB
        
        3. **Use Method 3 below**: Select "üîå USB/DroidCam" and try camera index 1 or 2
        
        4. **Real-time video**: Works like a regular webcam with smooth video!
        
        ### Method 3: IP Webcam App
        1. **Download IP Webcam app** on your phone:
           - Android: "IP Webcam" by Pavel Khlebovich
           - iOS: "IP Camera" or similar apps
        
        2. **Connect to same WiFi** as your computer
        
        3. **Start the server** in the app and note the IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100:8080)
        
        4. **Enter the URL below** in format: `http://192.168.1.100:8080/video`
